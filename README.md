# Pico Launchpad

*NOTE: This is a work in progress and only supports partial functionality at the
moment. Although it will power a Launchpad from its host port, it can't send it
any messages at the moment.  You can use a MIDI routing utility to connect the
Launchpad and this unit, but at the moment it can't send the sysex messages
required to paint the launchpad.  Trust me, I'm working on it.*

This project is meant as a starting point to create instruments and interfaces
using a Novation Launchpad and a dual-USB Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico 2).

This project was cloned from [my template
repository](https://github.com/duhrer/pico-midi-transformer), see that project
for more technical details and background information.

## Hardware Prerequisites

First, you'll need compatible hardware, which means a Pico or compatible unit
with two USB ports. The [Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A
Host](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723) is a good example of a unit that
has the second USB port built-in. You can also bring your own Pico (or
Pico-compatible) and wire it up as described in the documentation for the [OGX
Mini project](https://github.com/wiredopposite/OGX-Mini).

## Software Prerequisites

Once you have something to run the code on, you'll need to set up a build
environment. In the past, I have used:

1. The [Getting Started with Pico Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
2. The [Pico VS Code extension](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode)

Both of those are probably the easiest starting points, and if you hit upon
questions, there are lots of people working with them, so hopefully you can find
the guidance you need.

Personally, I use [distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) and [the docker container
created by `lukstep`](https://github.com/lukstep/raspberry-pi-pico-docker-sdk),
which I set up using commands like:

```
distrobox-create --image lukstep/raspberry-pi-pico-sdk -n pico-sdk
distrobox enter pico-sdk
```

## Checking out the Code

This project uses [git
submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for the
libraries it relies on. This means that if you
[clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) this repository, you won't have all
the code you need to successfully build binaries.

Although there are multiple ways to manage submodules, the simplest way to get
everything you need is to use a command like:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/duhrer/pico-midi-transformer.git
```

### Building

TODO: Add instructions for passing variables to configure the board type and USB PIO settings.

Once you have a working build environment, you should be able to build the code
in this project using commands like:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

You should end up with binaries in various formats.

### Installing

The simplest way to install a binary is to boot the microcontroller into
`bootsel` mode. Hold down the `bootsel` button and plug your microcontroller
into USB. A USB drive will appear, and you can copy one the `.uf2` files
generated by the build process onto your unit. It will process and install the
binary if it can. If it doesn't do anything, make sure you're building for the
right processor family, and try other test binaries, like the examples that come
with [the Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

If you're lucky enough to have a board with a reset button, all of the binaries
in this project also support entering `bootsel` mode by pressing the reset
button twice. You then copy the `pico-midi-transformer.uf2` file to the USB
drive as described above.

If you have a [pico probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/debug-probe/) or
other debugging unit, and if your microcontroller exposes the ports you need,
you can use `openocd` to deploy binaries. With this method, you deploy one of
the `.elf` files generated during the build process. Check the "Getting Started
with Pico Guide" for more info.

### Modules

This project collects a bunch of experiences I've created for various versions
of the Novation Launchpad family.  See [docs/modules.md] for a complete list and
instructions on how to use each module. To use any module:

1. Build all modules (see above).
2. Install the module on compatible hardware (see above).
3. Plug the "client" USB port into a computer.
4. Configure a sound-producing program or device to connect to the "Pico Launchpad" device.
5. Plug the launchpad into the "host" USB port of the microcontroller.
